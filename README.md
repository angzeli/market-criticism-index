# 📈 Market Criticism Index

This repository will implement a reproducible research pipeline for studying whether criticism narratives about the US equity market are related to later market returns, volatility, drawdowns, or reversals.

The current state includes the MVP scaffold, an initial GDELT data collection layer, headline cleaning/deduplication utilities, the K annotation sample/validation workflow, and daily Market Criticism Index construction. It does not yet implement market-data merging or empirical modelling.

## 🧭 Research Boundary

The project keeps the discourse and quantitative workflows separate. K's annotation/codebook work defines and validates what counts as market criticism. Automated keyword, NLP, and modelling steps are supporting tools, not replacements for that definition.

The analysis should avoid causal claims. Results should be described as associations, relationships, predictive tests, or event-study patterns.

## 🔄 Intended Workflow

1. Collect US-market-related headlines from structured sources such as GDELT.
2. Collect candidate criticism headlines using transparent market and criticism keyword queries.
3. Normalise headline text and deduplicate records while preserving raw data.
4. Export a mixed annotation sample for K under `data/interim/`.
5. Use K's labelled validation set to evaluate automated candidate extraction.
6. Build daily Market Criticism Index variables and category-specific measures.
7. Merge daily index variables with SPY, QQQ, RSP, and VIX market data.
8. Run baseline event studies and regressions with interpretable controls.
9. Save figures to `outputs/figures/` and regression tables to `outputs/tables/`.

## 🗂️ Data And Output Conventions

Raw data should never be overwritten. Generated headline, annotation, and modelling datasets should be written to `data/interim/` or `data/processed/`. Figures belong in `outputs/figures/`; regression tables belong in `outputs/tables/`.

The scaffold exposes these paths in `mci.config` so future implementation can keep outputs deterministic.

## 🧹 Cleaning And Alignment Assumptions

Headline titles are normalised for matching by lowercasing, replacing separator punctuation with spaces, removing other punctuation, and collapsing whitespace. Raw title text is preserved on cleaned record copies.

GDELT-style naive `seendate` timestamps with full time components are treated as UTC and converted to `America/New_York`. Date-only values are left unaligned because they are insufficient for the 16:00 New York close rule. Items seen after 16:00 New York time are assigned to the next trading day.

Generated cleaning and alignment outputs are rejected if they point under `data/raw/`. Alignment outputs default to `data/interim/`. When an explicit market calendar is supplied, alignment validates calendar coverage before writing; otherwise it falls back to weekdays only.

## 📝 K Annotation Workflow

Use the [K annotation workflow guide](docs/k_annotation_workflow.md) for sample locations, editable columns, accepted label values, and validation steps.

Build a sample from cleaned candidate and all-market headline CSVs:

```bash
python scripts/build_annotation_sample.py --candidate-csv data/interim/gdelt_candidate_criticism_20220101_20260531.csv --all-market-csv data/interim/gdelt_all_us_market_20220101_20260531.csv --seed 1
```

Validate completed labels after K saves CSVs under `data/processed/annotations/labelled/`:

```bash
python scripts/validate_annotations.py
```

## 📊 MCI Calculation

Daily MCI construction expects cleaned, date-aligned all-market and candidate-criticism headline CSVs. Date resolution uses `trading_day`, then `date`, then `published_date_ny`.

The daily index is:

```text
MCI = raw_criticism_count / total_market_article_count
```

The output has one row per observed all-market headline date, sorted ascending. If `total_market_article_count` is zero, `MCI` is left blank.

The rolling z-score column is current-inclusive and named for the configured window, for example:

```text
mci_rolling_60d_zscore = (MCI - rolling_mean_60d) / rolling_std_60d
```

The rolling z-score uses a strict valid-observation window. It is blank until the full window is available, and it remains blank when the rolling standard deviation is zero.

Input rows with missing or unparseable dates fail fast. Candidate counts are also checked against all-market counts by date so `MCI` does not exceed `1.0`.

When completed labels are supplied, matched `criticism_label = 0` candidates are excluded and matched `criticism_label = 1` candidates are counted. Matched labels must be resolved to `0` or `1`, and conflicting duplicate labels are rejected. Unmatched candidate rows still count as automated candidates. Category-specific columns are added only from matched positive labels with configured category labels, so they reflect labelled category coverage rather than automated category classification.

Build the daily MCI CSV:

```bash
python scripts/build_mci_daily.py --market-csv data/interim/gdelt_all_us_market_20220101_20260531.csv --criticism-csv data/interim/gdelt_candidate_criticism_20220101_20260531.csv --labels data/processed/annotations/labelled/ --overwrite
```

## 🛠️ Development

Install development dependencies when needed:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Install analysis dependencies when implementing the full pipeline:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[analysis,dev]"
```

Run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

Collect one month of all US-market-related GDELT headlines:

```bash
python scripts/collect_gdelt.py --query-type all_us_market --start-date 2022-01-01 --end-date 2022-01-31
```
